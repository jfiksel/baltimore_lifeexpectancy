The purpose of this project is to predict life expectancy in Baltimore on a single block resolution. The main source of data for life expectancy at the neighborhood level are the [Baltimore City Health Department Neighborhood Health Profiles](http://health.baltimorecity.gov/node/231). I plan on utilizing free data provided by [OpenBaltimore](https://data.baltimorecity.gov), which appears to have a more cleaned up version of the above data set in the [Children and Family Health & Well-Being (2010-2014)](https://data.baltimorecity.gov/Neighborhoods/Children-and-Family-Health-Well-Being-2010-2014-/rtbq-mnni) and [Housing and Community Development (2010-2014)](https://data.baltimorecity.gov/Neighborhoods/Housing-and-Community-Development-2010-2014-/mvvs-32jm) reports. The codebook is [here](https://data.baltimorecity.gov/Neighborhoods/BNIA-Vital-Signs-Codebook/ryvy-9zw6). 

### Main question
Can we predict life expectancy at the block-level resolution in Baltimore using various health, crime, and economic statistics collected at the individual house level and/or aggregated to the block or neighborhood level?

### Datasets that I have downloaded 

* [Children and Family Health & Well-Being (2010-2014)](https://data.baltimorecity.gov/Neighborhoods/Children-and-Family-Health-Well-Being-2010-2014-/rtbq-mnni)
* [Housing and Community Development (2010-2014)](https://data.baltimorecity.gov/Neighborhoods/Housing-and-Community-Development-2010-2014-/mvvs-32jm)
* [Building vacancies in Baltimore](https://data.baltimorecity.gov/Housing-Development/Vacant-Buildings/qqcv-ihn5) which provides the street and neighborhood of all current building vacancies. This is updated at least twice a month
* [Victim based crime](https://data.baltimorecity.gov/Public-Safety/BPD-Part-1-Victim-Based-Crime-Data/wsfq-mvij). Accessing this on Sept. 13, 2016 the most recent crime listed occurred on Sept. 3, 2016
* [Real property taxes](https://data.baltimorecity.gov/Financial/Real-Property-Taxes/27w9-urtv) at an address level
* [Liquor licenses](https://data.baltimorecity.gov/City-Services/Liquor-Licenses/xv8d-bwgi)
* [2010 Census data](https://data.baltimorecity.gov/Neighborhoods/Census-Demographics-2010/cix3-h4cy) at a neighborhood level
* [Grocery stores](https://data.baltimorecity.gov/Health/Grocery-Stores/uuwk-975y). Contains type of supermarket and location. Could be interesting to look at distance to closest grocery store, and clusters of small or limited groceries stores predict health outcomes
* [BPD Arrests](https://data.baltimorecity.gov/Public-Safety/BPD-Arrests/n29z-hvc9). Includes address of arrest for some, but not all arrests
* [Baltimore prositution](https://data.baltimorecity.gov/Public-Safety/Prostitution-in-Baltimore-City/hky9-jqjm)
* [Block-level state shape file](https://www.nhgis.org)
* [Restaurants in Baltimore](https://data.baltimorecity.gov/Culture-Arts/Restaurants/k5ry-ef3g)
* [ACS Block Group Household Income Data]

### Preprocessing
* Have used codebook available online to rename variables so they are more easily understandable
* Have cleaned up latitude and longitude where it applies 
* Lots of missing locations, especially on arrest data
    + Have to investigate if this is random throughout police districts, or is biased
* Use Google Maps API to get latitude and longitude for any data sets without this. Then use this to infer neighborhood & block for any datasets where neighborhood is not listed
    + Use R package rgdl to map property taxes by latitude and longitude to csa
* Clean up dates
* "Tidy" data. Separate data sets with numeric and character variables. Use either neighborhood or block as key

### Visualizations

csa <- readRDS(list.files(path=file.path("data", "raw_data"),

key <- na.omit(match(csa@data$Community, well_being$csa))
### Remove jail
csa <- csa[-51,]

### CSA coordinates to latitude and longitude
llprj <-  "+proj=longlat +ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84 +no_defs +towgs84=0,0,0"
csa <- spTransform(csa,  llprj)


### Plot CSA life expectancy 
csa@data$id <- csa@data$Community
csa@data$life_expectancy <- well_being$life_exepctancy[key]
csa.points <- fortify(csa, region="id")
csa.df <- join(csa.points, csa@data, by="id")
csa.df$life_expectancy <- as.numeric(csa.df$life_expectancy)

myggmap <- get_map(location="Baltimore", zoom=12)

ggmap(myggmap)+
  geom_path(data=csa.df, aes(x=long, y=lat, group=group), color="black")  +
  geom_polygon(data=csa.df, aes(x=long, y=lat, group=group, fill=life_expectancy), alpha=.4) +
  geom_point(data=victim_crime2015[victim_crime2015$description=="SHOOTING",], aes(x=longitude, y=latitude), alpha=.5) +
  scale_fill_gradientn("Life expectancy", colors=c('red', 'yellow', 'green')) +
  xlab("Longitude") + ylab("Latitude") + 
  ggtitle("Baltimore Life Expectancy and Shootings 2015")
```

### Statistical issues to overcome:

* Neighborhoods will be correlated (spatially and also based on other characteristics)
* We have aggregate neighborhooddata, but want to predict at an "observation" (block) level 
    + [Potentially interesting paper](http://faculty.som.yale.edu/ksudhir/workingpapers/Conditional%20Means%20Approach-JEctrics.pdf)
    + Not as many variables available on block level--will have to use readily available data to predict these
