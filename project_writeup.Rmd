The purpose of this project is to predict life expectancy in Baltimore on a single block resolution. The main source of data for life expectancy at the neighborhood level are the [Baltimore City Health Department Neighborhood Health Profiles](http://health.baltimorecity.gov/node/231). I plan on utilizing free data provided by [OpenBaltimore](https://data.baltimorecity.gov), which appears to have a more cleaned up version of the above data set in the [Children and Family Health & Well-Being (2010-2014)](https://data.baltimorecity.gov/Neighborhoods/Children-and-Family-Health-Well-Being-2010-2014-/rtbq-mnni) and [Housing and Community Development (2010-2014)](https://data.baltimorecity.gov/Neighborhoods/Housing-and-Community-Development-2010-2014-/mvvs-32jm) reports. The codebook is [here](https://data.baltimorecity.gov/Neighborhoods/BNIA-Vital-Signs-Codebook/ryvy-9zw6). 

### Main question
Can we predict life expectancy at the block-level resolution in Baltimore using various health, crime, and economic statistics collected at the individual house level and/or aggregated to the block or neighborhood level?

### Datasets that I have downloaded 

* [Children and Family Health & Well-Being (2010-2014)](https://data.baltimorecity.gov/Neighborhoods/Children-and-Family-Health-Well-Being-2010-2014-/rtbq-mnni)
* [Housing and Community Development (2010-2014)](https://data.baltimorecity.gov/Neighborhoods/Housing-and-Community-Development-2010-2014-/mvvs-32jm)
* [Building vacancies in Baltimore](https://data.baltimorecity.gov/Housing-Development/Vacant-Buildings/qqcv-ihn5) which provides the street and neighborhood of all current building vacancies. This is updated at least twice a month
* [Victim based crime](https://data.baltimorecity.gov/Public-Safety/BPD-Part-1-Victim-Based-Crime-Data/wsfq-mvij). Accessing this on Sept. 13, 2016 the most recent crime listed occurred on Sept. 3, 2016
* [Real property taxes](https://data.baltimorecity.gov/Financial/Real-Property-Taxes/27w9-urtv) at an address level
* [Liquor licenses](https://data.baltimorecity.gov/City-Services/Liquor-Licenses/xv8d-bwgi)
* [2010 Census data](https://data.baltimorecity.gov/Neighborhoods/Census-Demographics-2010/cix3-h4cy) at a neighborhood level
* [Grocery stores](https://data.baltimorecity.gov/Health/Grocery-Stores/uuwk-975y). Contains type of supermarket and location. Could be interesting to look at distance to closest grocery store, and clusters of small or limited groceries stores predict health outcomes
* [BPD Arrests](https://data.baltimorecity.gov/Public-Safety/BPD-Arrests/n29z-hvc9). Includes address of arrest for some, but not all arrests
* [Baltimore prositution](https://data.baltimorecity.gov/Public-Safety/Prostitution-in-Baltimore-City/hky9-jqjm)
* [Block-level state shape file](https://www.nhgis.org)
* [Restaurants in Baltimore](https://data.baltimorecity.gov/Culture-Arts/Restaurants/k5ry-ef3g)

### Datasets that I will/want to download
* [Walkscores](https://www.walkscore.com) through their API
    + Waiting to get API approved
    + Uses many of the variables that I already have access to, but gives combined walkscore and other statistics for specific locations
* [Shape files](https://data.baltimorecity.gov/Neighborhoods/Children-and-Family-Health-Well-Being-2010-2012-Sh/6btb-a7mu)
* [Zillow](http://www.zillow.com/howto/api/APIOverview.htm)
    + Need API
* Census block data
    
### Preprocessing
* Have used codebook available online to rename variables so they are more easily understandable
* Have cleaned up latitude and longitude where it applies 
* Lots of missing locations, especially on arrest data
    + Have to investigate if this is random throughout police districts, or is biased
* Use Google Maps API to get latitude and longitude for any data sets without this. Then use this to infer neighborhood & block for any datasets where neighborhood is not listed
    + Use R package rgdl to map property taxes by latitude and longitude to csa
* Clean up dates
* "Tidy" data. Separate data sets with numeric and character variables. Use either neighborhood or block as key

### Statistical issues to overcome:

* Neighborhoods will be correlated (spatially and also based on other characteristics)
* We have aggregate neighborhooddata, but want to predict at an "observation" (block) level 
    + [Potentially interesting paper](http://faculty.som.yale.edu/ksudhir/workingpapers/Conditional%20Means%20Approach-JEctrics.pdf)
    + Not as many variables available on block level--will have to use readily available data to predict these
